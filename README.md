# Project: Airbnb Rental Analysis in Montreal 🏛️

I am excited to share the outcome of my project completed during the data analysis bootcamp. 💻📊

## 🌟 Project: Airbnb Rental Analysis in Montreal 🌟

I developed an interactive application using Streamlit, which allows users to explore and analyze Airbnb rental data in the city of Montreal. This tool provides a detailed view of various aspects such as prices, availability, and property features, among others.

🔗 Link to the application: Airbnb Montreal · Streamlit (airbnb-montreal.streamlit.app)

## The analysis included:

🔧 Data preprocessing: Transformation of columns, handling missing values, and outliers.
🌍 Exploratory Data Analysis (#EDA): Including the visualization of interactive maps using the folium and geopandas libraries.
🤖 Implementation of machine learning models (regression models) to predict the prices of the listings.

This project allowed me to apply and consolidate my skills in Python, data analysis, and data visualization, as well as learn how to use tools like Streamlit to create interactive web applications.
